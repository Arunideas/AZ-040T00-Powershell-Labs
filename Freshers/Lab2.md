In this exercise, you'll use Windows PowerShell’s **Get-Help** and **Get-Command** commands to discover new commands that can complete specific tasks within Windows PowerShell. You'll also run several basic Windows PowerShell commands. In some instances, you might have to find the commands that you'll use to complete the task.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Find commands that'll accomplish specified tasks.
1. Run commands to accomplish specified tasks.

### Task 1: Find commands that'll accomplish specified tasks

- On **Windows Server 2019**, ensure that you're signed in as **Administrator** and determine the answers to the following questions:

  - What command would you run to resolve a DNS name?
  - What command would you run to make changes to a network adapter? After finding such a command, what parameter would you use to change its Media Access Control (MAC) address (on adapters that support changes to their MAC address)?
  - What command would let you enable a previously disabled scheduled task?
  - What command would let you block access to a file share by a particular user?
  - What command would you run to clear your computer’s local **BranchCache** cache?
  - What command would you run to display a list of Windows Firewall rules? What parameter of that command would display only enabled rules?
  - What command would you run to display a list of all locally bound IP addresses?
  - What command would you run to suspend an active print job in a print queue?
  - What native Windows PowerShell command would you run to review the content of a text file?

  ## Result
  
  After completing this exercise, you'll have demonstrated your ability to find and run Windows PowerShell commands that perform specific tasks.
