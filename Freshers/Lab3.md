lab:
    title: 'Lab: find content in **About** files' 
    module: 'Module 1: find content in About files'
--- 


In this exercise, you'll use help discovery techniques to find content in **About** files, and then use that content to answer questions about global Windows PowerShell functionality.

Remember that you must use **Get-Help** and wildcard characters. **About** files aren't commands, **Get-Command** will not be useful in this exercise.

The main task for this exercise is:

- Locate and review **About** help files.

### Task 1: Locate and review About help files

- Ensure that you'll still signed in to **Windows Server 2019** as **Administrator** from the previous exercise, and answer the following questions:

  - What comparison operator does Windows PowerShell use for wildcard string comparisons?
  - Are Windows PowerShell comparison operators typically case-sensitive?
  - How would you use `$Env` to display the **COMPUTERNAME** environment variable?
